Its taken me forever to create a website, mostly because I didnâ€™t like all of 
the platforms out there. Alas, I've found one I can call my own.


<img src="http://jekyllrb.com/img/logo-2x.png" align="right" width="40%">
As you might have noticed, this small site of mine is 'live and kicking and
I'd like to think that it was built on solid foundations, using 
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) as the static website generator of choice 
and hosted enthusiastically on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

It's an awesome combination and I recommend it to anyone that's in search
for a simple, yet effective way to get themselves on the binary encoded fields 
of the Internet.

While it's simplicity requires sites to be static (which is a good thing!),
dynamic content can be side-loaded via JavaScript or some other means, which
means there's no need to cry for the loss of comments or search. I'll address
the latter in some future post with a bit of a twist of my own.

Bringing the pieces together, I used the code from <http://rsms.me/>, borrowing
heavily from his styling and layout (eventually I'll give it a dash of
uniqueness). I really liked the more subtle theme of it and the way it nicely
scales to mobile devices. You can find Rasmus's brilliant work
[here](https://github.com/rsms/rsms.github.com).

In case someone wants to dig into the code on which this site is run, which is
a distilled and simplified version of the previous code, you can find the base 
code without my posts right 
[here](https://github.com/nvisnjic/jekyll-web-basic).


Happy coding
