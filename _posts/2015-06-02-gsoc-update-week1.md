And I can measure them fields now, which is nice.

![Lots of numbers](/images/mag_reads_small.jpg "It's a bit concerning that the readouts jump by a factor of 100 when I put my phone close to the sensor :/")

*Worked on:*

* Hardware setup and configuration
* Basic readouts of MPU9250 via SPI
* Testing currently available drivers and available code
* Looking into what can be reused and what should be redone
* Final touches on the presentation + Intro video (awaiting upload when the VPN is stable)
* Blog space ready for tracking progress
* Received the PNI RM3100 modules via FedEx

*Issues:*

* The Great Firewall of China (see intro video above)
* Hackaday.io page still pending

*To be worked on:*

* Getting a cohesive setup for the sensors
* Interfacing with the PNI RM3100 magnetometers
* Looking into the parameter computation ML algorithms (and how to optimally implement them in the coming weeks)
* PRU viability will be considered
* Hackaday.io page + more blogging
