Haven't been around to post much, was mostly engulfed with enjoying Shanghai
and it's surroundings. While I am enjoying China, I did have time
to look around for a good next project to tackle and I've found just the one!

Presenting BeagleSat (well, I call it that, for now), a Google Summer of
Code 2015 project under [BeagleBoard.org](http://www.beagleboard.org).

I've just got accepted into the program and I'll be posting updates as the
project progresses.

You can read a bit more about what's planned on the [proposal page](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/public/google/gsoc2015/niko_visnjic/5629499534213120). 

Be sure to stick around and find all about this Beaglenauts trip to space ready hardware, it's gonna make for one swell summer!
