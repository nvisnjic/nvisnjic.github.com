Second week of GSoC 2015 coding for the BeagleSat project. Stuff has been done, exams are upon us.

*Worked on:*

* Hardware setup mostly done
* Finished layout graphic and added it to video and some other minor edits
* Readouts from PNI RM3100 via SPI working, more testing this week
* Writing code for both sensors to measure and store a workable amount of data for ML estimator

*Issues:*

* AdviceRequest@BeagleBoard: Recommendations for C/C++ ML library (or any optimized computational library for minimizations), links are awesome to 
* Finals week, eg. a lot of distractions
* Uploading video to YouTube, if it doesn't work until tomorrow, I'll upload it via non google services or send it to someone

*To be worked on:*

* Drivers and data collector code for the sensors
* ML stuff, have to start implementing it (test with Octave, later implement in C++)
* Hackaday.io page + more blogging (still a bit to do)
